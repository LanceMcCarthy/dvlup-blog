UPDATE

The winners have been picked, congratulations to all (I emailed you directly if you were a winner)! If you did not win, keep your app up to date (update at least once every 60 days) and you'll always be eligible for my giveaways.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm raffling off all my remaining gadgets and swag in two weeks (deadline is Dec 31st)! The only 2 conditions to enter are that you are in my region (see below) and that you published or updated an app in the last 6 months (since June 31st).

If you need to update or publish an app, you have just enough time to get it in. If you don't have an app yet, I recommend going to [Microsoft's App Studio](http://apps.windowsstore.com/) and building one... you can build a store-ready app in an hour. _If you don't have a Windows Phone DevCenter account I will get you one, this will also give you a Windows 8 developer account._

The Prizes:
-----------

*   3 [Nokia Lumia 800s](http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia800/)
*   1 [JBL PLAYUP wireless NFC speaker](http://www.nokia.com/global/products/accessory/md-51w/) (black)
*   1 [Nokia Wireless Charging Stand](http://www.nokia.com/global/products/accessory/dt-910/) (white)
*   10 Reprogrammable Dvlup NFC sticker strips (5 NFC tags on each)
*   16 USB car lighter phone chargers

To Enter:
---------

Simply email me ([ext-lance.mccarthy@nokia.com](mailto:ext-lancewmccarthy@nokia.com)) the following info by Dec 31st:

*   **Name** (first/last)
*   **Location** (city/state only)
*   **Dvlup Username** (if you don't have one, go to [www.dvlup.com](http://www.dvlup.com) and register. It's free and takes 30 seconds)
*   **The app's link** to the store (the one you've published or updated).

That's it! I'll draw the winner on Jan 2nd and notify the winners via email.
