On Behalf of Microsoft
----------------------

For about 7-8 years, I did a lot of behind-the-scenes work for Microsoft; as a ghost blog writer, video producer and handling the official social media accounts (Sprinklr is awesome). It was a great experience that I dont want to lose these resume fillers and wanted to compile the top items here.

You'll probably recognize many of these items and had no idea that I was behind the camera/pen. Enjoy the nostalgia!

#### Official Videos

I was the off-camera interviewer and script writer for the following content

#### Official Microsoft Blog Posts

For a couple years, I was the main content creator behind the Windows Developer blog content. I published under the "Windows App Team" pen name, with a few exceptions (like a Michael Crump series). The following links are my posts from those years (that I was able to find/remember).

Unfortunately, there are several more that I can't find links to and are lost to time. However, I built many great friendships while I was there that can attest to my participation in both the blog content, but also the live event content (particularly Microsoft Build).

As I mentioned above, some of that content involved social media, here are some of those items I had fun producing and performing.

Code

Although much of the code I've written has been merged into official demos at some point, there are still some items that are outside that curtain. Here are the items I could find:
