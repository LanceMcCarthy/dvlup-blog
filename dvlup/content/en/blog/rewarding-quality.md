=========================================

So you've published an app and you've worked hard to keep its rating at 4+ stars. You've had at least 50 ratings, proving that it's not a fluke. Now what? Let me bring you into the fold of the elite.

You and your app will get:

*   **Windows Phone Store Placement**
*   **App Highlights Placement** (Nokia's app that is preinstalled on all new Nokia Lumias)
*   **NAX Credits** for you to advertise your app in other apps

So if you meet the conditions (has minimum 50 ratings, is currently 4 stars or higher, and you're DVLUP member or eligible to be) send me an email **ext-lance.mccarthy@nokia.com**
