As a nice year-end present for us, he has done it again, visit [Scott Hanselman's 2021 Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-2021-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-windows/).

Someone had left a great comment about compiling a list of all his suggestions as Windows Package Manager (aka winget) or Chocolatey package IDs. I mentioned this to Scott and he thought it was a great idea, too. So I offered to compile the list.

Why is this a wonderful suggestion? You only need to run a quick one-liner command, `winget install <id>` or `choco install <id>`, and you have installed the software.

If you've never used **winget** it is a really easy way to install full GUI applications. First, you need to make sure Windows Package Manager (aka winget) is installed, [instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget). The easiest way to do this... 1. Go to the [Winget Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases), 2. Download the latest .**appxbundle** file, 3. Open that file. Done!

Once installed, open Powershell (or Windows Terminal), and run the `winget install` command followed by the app's ID. For example, `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` will run a script for you that does ALL of the work to install VS Code!

Here you can see me install **Media File Manager** app using `winget install LancelotSoftware.MediaFileManager`

Below is the list of the packages I was able to find. I first searched on winget. If it wasn't there, then I tried Chocolatey. The source is the 3rd column, just start with that command and then use the ID

If you need to use any of the **choco** packages, follow the Chocolatey's installations [instructions here](https://chocolatey.org/install). Then do the same thing we did with winget! For example, `choco install NuGetPackageExplorer`.

Here are a few more tools that aren't in Scott's list, but I use on certain purpose-specific machines (media servers, devops agents, etc).

```
choco install mkvtoolnix
choco install mp3tag
choco install FileBot
choco install OpenAudible
```
