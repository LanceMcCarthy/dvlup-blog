Almost every developer I speak with agrees that getting a nicely working OAuth flow can be difficult. After much trial and error, I've built a UWP [ContentDialog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ContentDialog) that makes this easy and has built-in refresh token support.

Using the LoginDialog
---------------------

This is very simple to use, when the app launches, instantiate the dialog by passing your Live SDK ClientID and let the LoginDialog do the heavy lifting:

```csharp
// Pass your app's OAuth ClientId (sometimes called an AppId)
var loginDialog = new LoginDialog("YourAppClientId");

// \*\*\* Perform login \*\*\*\* //
// Case 1 - If the user was previously signed in, there is a refresh\_token stored and no user-entered credentials are needed.
// Case 2 - If the access token fails, or if it's the first sign-in, the user will see a popup to enter credentials.
await loginDialog.SignInAsync();

if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(loginDialog.Authentication))
{
    // This will be the access token you can use for API calls.
    var accessToken = loginDialog.Authentication;

    // Make your API calls with the accessToken, for example:
    var user = await apiService.GetUserProfileAsync(accessToken);
}
```

This works just like a MessageDialog, but instead will show a WebView for the user to sign in, or automatically sign them in silently if they were previously logged in.

Operational Summary
-------------------

Explaining OAuth 2.0 is outside the scope of this article, but to summarize there are a couple round trip to the authentication endpoints.

1.  Load the sign-in landing page and the user signs in with their credentials.
2.  In the redirect after successful sign-in, you'll get an `access_token` and a `refresh_token` for that authenticated user.

The `access_token` is what is used in all of your API calls that verifies the application is operating on the behalf of that user. The `access_token` expires after a preset amount of time (e.g. 60 minutes), after which time you have to request another `access_token`.

Here is where the `refresh_token` comes in handy. You _could_ go back to step #1 above, but this would require the user re-enter their credentials. Instead, you can just use the `refresh_token` you already have for the user to get a new `access_token` without ever interrupting them to show a WebView.

This is what the LoginDialog does for you, when you call **SignInAsync()** the following happens:

*   Checks to see if there is a `refresh_token` stored locally. If there isn't one, show the WebView and have the user sign in for the first time.
*   If there is a `refresh_token` stored locally, then use that to automatically get a new `access_token` without showing the dialog

Since this is general OAuth 2.0 workflow, you could probably adapt the dialog to work for other OAuth 2 endpoints by changing the dialog's `_signInUri`, `_signOutUri` and `_redirectUrl` values.

Wrapping Up
-----------

The LoginDialog lets you have the least amount of interruption to the user while quickly getting an access token for your API use.
