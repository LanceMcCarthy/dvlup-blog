In case you missed it, I spoke this year at DevReach 2020. DevReach is Europe's Premier Developer Conference that takes place every year in Sofia, Bulgaria. This year's conference was online only, but was still a lot of fun.

In my session, I show you how to write GitHub Actions workflows for a full CI/CD experience that automatically builds and releases your Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS and UWP apps.

You can get all the source code and see the GitHub workflows at [DevReach Companion on GitHub](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/DevReachCompanion) (_you can also open DevReach 2019 folder and see the Azure DevOps Pipelines from last year's session_).
