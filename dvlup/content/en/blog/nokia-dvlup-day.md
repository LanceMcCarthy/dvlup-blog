**Track One**: Native development (10AM - 2PM): Learn how to write Windows Phone apps with XAML/C# and explore the amazing APIs available to you. From the built-in task classes to advanced Bluetooth/NFC/Camera approaches, Lance McCarthy, Nokia Ambassador for the Northeast US, will show you how easy it is to write great apps with ease. This track comes with full source code and slides.

**Track Two**: App Studio development (10AM-2PM): Learn how to generate a store-ready Windows Phone app in under an hour using Microsoft's App Studio. Nick Landry, Nokia Ambassador for the Mid-Atlantic US, will show you how to get started with App Studio and also take you through how to download the source code for the finished app to customize it even further.

**Track Three**: Game Development (10 AM-2PM): Learn how to make fun games for Windows Phone and Windows 8 using Unity3D and Construct2. Michael Cummings, Microsoft DPE, will show you how to code casual 2D games for Windows 8 and Windows Phone using a variety of technologies such as Unity, GameMaker, Construct 2, HTML5 and/or MonoGame. (If you had originally signed up on Microsoft's event page, that event listing has been cancelled. Simply go to the Eventbrite link at the top of this page and register there instead)

**Combined track** (2:15-5PM): A combination of app demos from the event hosts that highlight their favorite approaches to Windows Phone development (for example, Lance will demonstrate some Windows Phone Bluetooth and Netduino fun). Each presenter will spend 30 minutes to show you the app and dissect it for you to see how to do it yourself. This session is to spark your imagination.

Developer Environment (MacBook WPDev Kit)
-----------------------------------------

To write native Windows Phone 8 apps, you will need to be using Windows 8 Pro. If you do not have windows 8 Pro, you can do track 2 and make a Windows Phone App Studio app.

Developers with a Macbook: If you are a developer with a MAC, you can show up early (**8:00 AM**) for the MAC Clinic and you'll be provided with a MAC DEV KIT. This contains a copy of **Parallels** and a copy of **Windows 8 Pro**. They will help you setup your mac so that you can develop Windows Phone apps. _**Email Lance McCarthy as soon as possible to set up your MAC DEV KIT**,_ otherwise it will be first-come, first serve (email: [BostonDvlupDay@outlook.com](mailto:BostonDvlupDay@outlook.com) ).
