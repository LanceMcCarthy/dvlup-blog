I recently needed to send image data to a server for processing and thought I'd share how to do that using System.Net.Http.**HttpClient** in a UWP (Universal Windows) app. First, let's start with the API's requirements, it states:

Parameter: **image** - The image parameter should be the binary file data for the image you would like analyzed (PNG, GIF, JPG only). Files cannot be larger than 500k.

So that means I have to send image data as binary data with the parameter **image**. I can use System.Net.Http.**ByteArrayContent** for the image data. To get the image data from the file as a `byte[]` the approach I use is the following (there are other ways to do this):

```csharp
var myImageFile = await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.GetFileAsync(fileName);

byte fileBytes; 

using (var fileStream = await myImageFile.OpenStreamForReadAsync()) 
{ 
    var binaryReader = new BinaryReader(fileStream); 
    fileBytes = binaryReader.ReadBytes((int)fileStream.Length); 
}
```


Now that I have a **byte\[\]**, I can create an instance of System.Net.Http.**ByteArrayContent** to hold the image's binary data:

```csharp
var imageBinaryContent= new ByteArrayContent(fileBytes);
```

Normally when sending content, you'd just pass the content as itself to the **PostAsync()** method directly. However, because I need to send the content with the parameter name **image**, I'll need to use System.Net.Http.**MultiPartFormDataContent**. It allows you to set content with a parameter name. Here's how I did it:

```csharp
var multipartContent = new MultipartFormDataContent();
multipartContent.Add(imageBinaryContent, "image");
```

Now that we have the content ready to go, all that's left to do is to pass it to **PostAsync()** when the call is made. Here's the entire snippet:

```csharp
//get image file 
var myImageFile = await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.GetFileAsync(fileName);

//convert filestream to byte array 
byte[] fileBytes;
using (var fileStream = await myImageFile.OpenStreamForReadAsync()) 
{ 
    var binaryReader = new BinaryReader(fileStream); 
    fileBytes = binaryReader.ReadBytes((int)fileStream.Length); 
}

//instantiate the client 
using(var client = new HttpClient()) {

//api endpoint 
var apiUri = new Uri("http://someawesomeapi.com/api/1.0/");

//load the image byte[] into a System.Net.Http.ByteArrayContent 
var imageBinaryContent = new ByteArrayContent(fileBytes);

//create a System.Net.Http.MultiPartFormDataContent 
var multipartContent = new MultipartFormDataContent(); multipartContent.Add(imageBinaryContent, "image");

//make the POST request using the URI enpoint and the MultiPartFormDataContent 
var result = await client.PostAsync(apiUri, multipartContent); 
} 
```

I hope this makes things easier for you,

Happy coding!

As suggested by my buddy [Scott Lovegrove](https://twitter.com/scottisafool), you could also move this into an HttpClient Extension Method. How much functionality you put in it is up to you, but I went with most of it. To use it, simply, pass the StorageFile, API url and the parameter name:

```csharp
var result = await client.PostImageDataAsync(myImageFile, "https://myapi.com/", "image");
```
