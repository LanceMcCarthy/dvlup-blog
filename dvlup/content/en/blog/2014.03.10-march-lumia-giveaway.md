#### UPDATE: The winner for March is Shawn Murphy, congratulations!

To reward developers staying active, I am giving away a Nokia Lumia (winner's choice of the 1020, 928, 925 or 920). Eligibility is simple::

1.  Publish or update a Windows Phone app between Feb 1st and March 31st
2.  You live in one of the following states: MA, RI, CT, NH, ME, VT, MI, OH, IL or IN (USA state abbreviations, not countries).

If you can say yes to 1 and 2, send me an email to **ext-lance.mccarthy at nokia dot com** with the following information (deadline is March 31st):

*   Name (first/last)
*   Dvlup username (if you don't have one yet, [sign up for free](http://www.dvlup.com/lance/invite). It only takes 30 seconds)

Easy right? I'll draw the winner on April 1st and notify you via email. Good luck!
