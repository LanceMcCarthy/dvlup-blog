It's been a while since I've written a new post. Part of this reason was an ongoing battle with trying to move my Wordpress installation. It used to be running ina very expensive Windows App Service on Azure. While there is a new Linux-based App Service option, it will take similar amounts of effort to migrate it so I thought "why not take this opportunity to try new things?".

The first thing I needed to do was export the 10+ years of posts that already existed. This was relatively easy enough, there are several Wordpress Exporter/Importer plugins. It exported the history, images and all the important stuff into a zip file.

Okay, now it's time to think about where to move it. I've tried a few things, which I think will be very useful for you as well, so let's go thorugh them.

## WordPress via Docker Compose

I've been really loving running containers lately. I have a bunch of self-hosted services for personal use, running on top of some subdomains (a NAS, VPN, home automation, etc). So my first idea was to spin up Wordpress in a container.

This was by far, the most easiest, simplest way to migrate to another instance. Spinning up Wordpress via docker compose is fantastic because it lets oyu define botht he mariadb container and the wordpress container at the same time.

1. Create a directory `mkdir mywordpress && cd mywordpress`
2. Create a file, named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

    ```yml
    services:
        wordpress:
            image: wordpress
            restart: unless-stopped
            links:
             - mariadb:mysql
            environment:
                WORDPRESS_DB: "wordpress"
                WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: "change-me"
                WORDPRESS_DB_USER: "mySqlUser"
            ports:
             - 82:80
            volumes:
             - ./html-mywordpress:/var/www/html

        mariadb:
            image: mariadb
            restart: unless-stopped
            environment:
                MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'change-me-to-some-rootuser-password'
                MYSQL_DATABASE: 'wordpress'
                MYSQL_USER: 'mySqlUser'
                MYSQL_PASSWORD: 'change-me'
            volumes:
            - ./database-mywordpress:/var/lib/mysql
    ```
3. In the same directory as the file, run the `docker compose up -d` command

Done! You can now go to http://localhost:82 and see the initial setup experience for WordPress. Just install the same Export/Import plugin and import your stuff.

Now that you have this running, how do you expose it to the internet safely? I personally recommend using [nginxproxymanager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/). It is a fun and easy to use reverse proxy with HTTPS, SSL and automatic LetsEncrypt support. You even use docker compose to set that up, see the [Quick Start](https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/#quick-setup) docs. Then port forward 80 and 443 in your router to the nginxproxymanager and you can have as many self-hosted, HTTPS enabled sites as you want.

See this **real** running example => https://vma.care/. It's using everything I just explained and it works significantly fast than it did on Azure.

## GitHub Pages & Hugo - Trying Something New

So, why am I writing about Hugo if WordPress is working so well on Docker? The problem I have is with a technicality with top level domain routing in an environment where I originally designed only for subdomains. My real reverse proxy is quite complicated, it runs on a professional enterprise system [Progress Kemp Loadmaster](https://kemptechnologies.com/virtual-load-balancer), just because I have a license and wanted some experience.

So, I considered alternate solutions where I didn't need to have my own reverse proxy for this site. I instantly thought about using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! Unfortunately, you cannot run WordPress on GitHub Pages hosts only static site (no server runtime).

> Yes, there is one exception... if you can get the static site to use the client environment for the runtime, like WASM. A good example of this is .NET's Blazor, which can be deployed as a WASM app, see [this tutorial and demo](https://github.com/TenaciousDev/BlazorGitHubPagesDemo).

I started looking around for good blogging static sites and came across Hugo. Some things immediately caught my attention

- It has a HUGE range of styling options and themes => https://themes.gohugo.io/
- You can write content using markdown => https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/ (I prefer using markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors)
- It works perfectly with GitHub Pages (commit -> GitHub Actions -> your site gets instantly updated).

### Conversion

Now that I have decided on what kind of site and theme I want, I need to figure out how to get all my WordPress content into Hugo. The good news is Hugo knows this is a need and maintains a list of migration tools at https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/. Under the [WordPress section](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/#wordpress), we see four different options.

I used the **wordpress-to-hugo-exporter** one. It worked great for me, see the [README](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter) for more specific details to understand how you might want to use the tool.

After the conversion, I did have to mnake some small tweaks because some of the URLs in my blog were hard coded to HTTP links... but this is a simple Find & Replace option. Or you can just make sure any HTTP links are always redirected to HTTPS (a setting in GitHub)

### GitHub Actions & GitHub Pages

Now with the site's content done, it's time to configure the workflow that actually published the site update whenever there is a commit to the `main` branch.

The fastest and easiest way to do this is to have GitHub Pages settings create the workflow file for you.

1. Go to **Settings**, then select **Pages**.
2. Follow the instructions to setup the site and configure your domain's DNS setting.
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" to avoid any problems from lingering HTTP links from WordPress.

When you're done, it should look something like this:

![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/github-pages-settings.png)


When you make a new commit to the triggering branch, the workflow will be executed by GitHub Action and your page will get updated. Here is what it looks like after one of my runs:

## Tips

There are some things to keep in mind that I learned: 

### Image Root URL
You might be tempted to change where all your images are stored, but this will break all of your existing blog post's links to those images. On WordPress, the root URL for images would usually be domain/YYYY/MM/image.png, but it was probably exported to `/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/image.png`. You can think of this `wp-content/uploads` folder as the same thing as the `static` folder of the Hugo site. Any file in the static folder gets resolved directly on the root of the site.

I would look at how all the image links are in your posts and make a decision to keep the wp-content prefix or move the year folders directly to the static folder. This comes down to how images are linked in your exported post's url links.

### Image Size Suffixes

Sometimes WordPress will put a size suffix on your image file names in the blog post content. For example, an image link in a post might be linked to **MyPic-1024x715.png**, but the actual file name is **MyPic.png**. The easiest way to find these for a quick fix is to search for the common dimension, then remove the suffixes as you go.

In my case, it was `1024` width, but varying heights:

![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-size-suffix.png)

### Code Blocks

You might have some lingering `<pre>` or `[sourcecode language=""][/sourcecode]` blocks that held code examples. Consider spending a little bit of time changing them to the *three-backtick* block.

#### Before

```
    <pre>
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    </pre>
```
or

```
    [sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [/sourcecode]
```

#### After

```
    ```csharp
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    ```
```

It gives you great code coloring and formatting. You already saw some YAML examples above, here's what it looks like for C# 

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
}
```

### Escape Characters

I've found that many of my code blocks had escape characters still in there from WordPRess's HTML conversation.  For example, `Los\_Angeles` is supposed to be `Los_Angeles` or inside code blocks `\[SomeAttribute\]` is supposed to be `[SomeAttribute]`.

Consider using a Find & Replace action here as well for the following:

- `\_` to `_`
- `\[` to `[`
- `\]` to `]`
- `\-` to `-`

Note: Avoid using a Replace All, some might be legitimate escapes. It is usually in code blocks that they shouldn't be there.

### Sanity Check

Finally, my best piece of advice is to consider when you might want to stop making manual tweaks in old irrelevant posts. For example, before 2014, I stopped fixing XAML code blocks for Windows Phone posts... I only fixed broken image links. While you still want the history and pictures, the code is no longer useful unless it is teaching a lesson that can be agnostic of the deprecated platform.
