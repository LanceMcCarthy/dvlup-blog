**\[UPDATE\]**

**This offer ends midnight, Sunday, October 20th, 2013. If you have been stalling, now is the time to get it finished up.**

Here's my current offer for all you devs who are sitting on the fence about creating a Windows Phone app:

**I will give you a Nokia Premium Developer Program token ($1500 value) if you email me your working prototype for Windows Phone.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll then help you finish the app by providing guidance, resources or whatever you need to get it ready for the store. You can use any number of resources to build this prototype:

*   Microsoft's App Studio (no coding needed, [see this post](http://j.mp/15P0SLY) )
*   Tons of [sample source code and accompanying slides](http://j.mp/W0ekWZ)
*   Use Bob Tabor's amazing [Getting Started video series](http://j.mp/13L4D04)
*   [My resources page](http://j.mp/SuFMsG) containing tutorials, sample code, videos and much more. There is something in there for the beginner as well as the expert.

There hasn't been a better time to get started and become a bona fide Windows Phone developer. When you're ready, [send me an email](http://j.mp/134MFIm) with the info below and attach the prototype. I'll reply and bring you on board.

*   Name (first/last)
*   Location (city/state)
*   DevCenter publisher name and GUID (if you have one)
*   Dvlup.com username (if you don't have one, go to [http://Dvlup.com](http://Dvlup.com) and sign up. its free and take 30 seconds)

Happy coding!

**NOTE**: This is only available for developers living in the US or Canada. If you don't live in MA, NH, VT, CT, RI, ME, IL, MI, IN or VA, don't worry! I will forward your email to your local Ambassador, who will honor the same deal. Now get those fingers whirring away at the keys of wpdev awesomeness :)
