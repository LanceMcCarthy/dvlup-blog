I'm honored to be chosen by Microsoft to be a Dev M.C. for Microsoft Build 2021! Part of my duties as an MC is to help guide you through the gamut of sessions and resources available to you. This post is to share these things with you.

It's almost halfway through 2021 right now, at this point most of us have become proficient at attending remote events. From sending the kids to virtual school, 1:1 work meetings, or major conferences requiring a personal agenda, we've learned to navigate the virtual landscape of bringing the remote venue into your home.

Microsoft Build 2021 is looking to be a great event. If you're a Windows or mobile .NET dev, you might be having some difficulty finding the right sessions for your schedule because there's no "Windows Dev" filter option. To help you with this, I've put together a list of the sessions that are relevant to Windows, .NET and MAUI and more.

One of my favorite features of the Build 2021 Session Scheduler is there is a clear distinction between on-demand sessions and live sessions. You can add the on-demand sessions to your "Backpack" which you can watch at your leisure

Session Schedule
----------------

First, let's start with my Session schedule. You can actually see everything I'm attending by opening this URL [https://mybuild.microsoft.com/attendee/2733d203-b93c-4442-bc34-10ec5c73b0ee](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/attendee/2733d203-b93c-4442-bc34-10ec5c73b0ee&Wt.mc_ic=dx_MVP5000553)
