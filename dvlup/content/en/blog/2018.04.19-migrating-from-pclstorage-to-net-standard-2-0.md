If you're a Xamarin Forms developer, you've likely used [PCLStorage](https://github.com/dsplaisted/PCLStorage) (or other Dependency Service) to interact with the target platform's file system in the portable class library's code. However, since November 2017, Xamarin.Forms now uses a .NET Standard 2.0 class library and PCLStorage is no longer supported.

System.IO.File
--------------

This isn't a problem because in .NET Core 2.0 you now have access to System.IO.File's GetFolderPath and SpecialFolder methods (see [System.IO.File in .NET Core 2.0 docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file?view=netcore-2.0)).

Thus, you can get a path to the app's local folder (the one that the app can save to) without having to write a Dependency Service (which is what PCLStorage does) by using:

```csharp
var localFolder = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData);
``` 

IMPORTANT: Make sure you always use Path.Combine to create the file path because different platforms use different path separators

```csharp
var filePath = Path.Combine(LocalFolder, "notes.txt");
``` 

With a reference to the file path,  you can now access the file. For example reading the text:

```csharp
var notes = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
```

**Functional Demo**
-------------------

As a _very_ _simple_ example, I created a couple extension methods for **Stream** and **Byte\[\]** in the below FileExtensions class.

To test it, I created a **ContentPage** that downloads an image, saves it using the extension method and set a **FileImageSource** to confirm that it's a file (instead of just using a StreamImageSource).

Note that the extension methods are very basic and shouldn't be used in production as-is (i.e. no defensive programming code).

Here is the result at runtime on UWP:
