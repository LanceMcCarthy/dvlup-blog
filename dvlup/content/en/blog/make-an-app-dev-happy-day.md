The Windows Phone developer community is amazing in and of itself, but what happens when you add something like [#makeAnAppDevHappyDay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makeAnAppDevHappyDay&src=typd)? You get pure _awesomeness_. What is **#makeAnAppDevHappyDay**?  Nokia DVLUP added fuel to an idea started by Dan Colasanti for developers to help them get the word out about their apps and generate app reviews.

### Share your app...

Post your app's name and link to the store on twitter with the #makeAnAppDevHappyDay, other devs will download your app and leave a review. you do the same for them (It's also a great way for you to find new apps). Here is an example:

Check out my latest app, \[app name here\] thanks! \[app link here\] #MakeAnAppDevHappyDay

### Share another app...

It is also a way to let the developers know that you have rated this app, for example:

I just rated \[app name here\] five stars, great job guys! You gotta try it out \[app link here\] #MakeAnAppDevHappyDay

### When is it?

This happens every month on the first Friday. Just search the hashtag, or use [this direct link](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makeAnAppDevHappyDay&src=typd) and enjoy! I'm turning on comments for this blog post, leave a comment below and let everyone know #MakeAnAppDevHappyDay has worked for you
