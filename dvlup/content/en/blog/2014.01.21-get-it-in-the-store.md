#### UPDATE: This event is sold-out! If you were not able to register in time and need help getting your app published, [send me an email](http://nokiawpdev.wordpress.com/about/ "About") and I'll help you directly.

WPDev Day
---------

Me and several other experts will be spending 6 hours with you on Saturday February 1st, 2014 to help you over come any obstacles that is preventing you from publishing an app. If you do not have any apps in the works, then come and build an App Studio app with our help. **Click the Eventbrite button above to get your ticket**.

**Important**: This is a very limited seating event and is intended for the Northeast United States, please do not register if you are 6000 miles away or do not intend on showing up, you'll only be taking a seat away from another dev who needs it.

Here is the preliminary schedule (subject to tweaking):

*   **12 PM DevCenter Submission Walkthrough** (30 minutes): See just how easy it is to submit and publish an app worldwide
*   **12:30 PM Build an app in 30 minutes with App Studio** (30 minutes): See how to build an app from an idea to publishable in 30 minutes, literally.
*   **1 PM - 1:30 PM Lunch**: I'll be providing food and snacks. This is when you think about what you need help with or when you should think of your app idea for App Studio.
*   **1:30-6 PM Hands-on time**: The experts will be available to help during this time. They will be walking around helping and/or attending to requests for help.

By the end of the day I fully expect everyone's apps will be ready and submitted to DevCenter and on it's way to the global app marketplace.

**What will you need to bring?**

*   If you need help on an existing app, bring your laptop dev environment with your app on it.
*   If you want to build an app without any code, bring a laptop that has a modern browser (IE10-11, Chrome). You'll only need your browser to build and submit the app to the store. If you do not have a Windows Phone, the experts will be able to help you test the app on their phone
