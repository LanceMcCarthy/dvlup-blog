when you first start using Azure DevOps or Visual Studio AppCenter, you'll probably encounter the need to download what's known as a SecureFile. These files are usually code signing certificates, Android keystore or Apple provisioning files.

The tricky, and usually very frustrating part, is how to use these in your pipeline's YAML file. when first designing it, you see different ways the parameter is defined. Let me simply it so that you can quickly debug why you get the frustrating "**The secure file does not exist or has not been authorized for use**" error.

When you upload a file to the SecureFiles tab in the DevOps project's Library, it can be directly referred to using the file name. Since you usually want to keep this file name out of the build output logs, you'd typically put the name in a Variable and only reference that variable in the YAML when you need the file name.

This however can turn into a nightmare because you would expect that you can use that variable as a way to use the file. However, the Download Secure File task creates another variable to reference that file. It will append ".secureFilePath" to the name and any of your steps will break.

Practical Example
-----------------

Let's go through an example that you can use to help solve your error. First, let's look at my SecureFiles tab and see the PFX file I use for signing my code:

![](/dvlup-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png)

As I just mentioned, if this were a really important file name, I wouldn't want "LancelotSoftwareCSR.pfx" to show up in the build output logs. Especially if the pipeline is set to public. You would instead create a variable that has the value of that filename:

![](/dvlup-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-2.png)

When you go to use this in your pipeline, you generally first download it to the DevOps agent by using a Download Secure File Task, like this:

```
\- task: DownloadSecureFile@1
  inputs:
    secureFile: $(signingCert.secureFile)
    # which is the same as doing this 
    # secureFile: 'LancelotSoftwareCSR.pfx'
```
