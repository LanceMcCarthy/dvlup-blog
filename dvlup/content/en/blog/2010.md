There's an amazing new effect in the Composition APIs available in the Creator's Update and it's more powerful than you think, the [SceneLightingEffect.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Composition.Effects.SceneLightingEffect)

The reason it's so powerful is because it overrides the default lighting properties applied in a [CompositionLight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.compositionlight) and lets you create really cool materials by changing the default that the values that the mathematics of lighting Win3D uses to light a scene when composing UI elements in the Visual layer.

Microsoft uses this for the materials that came with the Fall Creatror's Update SDK (which is still in preview right now).

Materials like RevealBrush and Acrylic use this API to create unique lighting for UWP apps.
