## Bio by peers

[Lance McCarthy](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dvluper/), Microsoft MVP, is an exceptional community leader with an acute expertise for all things .NET and C# (especially on the XAML stack) as well as HoloLens/Mixed Reality applications. Lance is very helpful online, guiding and answering questions from Microsoft developers on Twitter as [@l_anceM](http://twitter.com/l_anceM). He organizes & hosts events in the Boston area such as user group nights, mini-code camps and full hackathons (like [this successful](http://blogs.telerik.com/windowsphoneteam/posts/13-05-09/see-what-happened-at-the-windows-phone-boston-hackathon) one in Boston).

As a [Developer Ambassador](http://blog.dvlup.com/2013/04/23/get-to-know-guitar-playing-airplane-flying-telerik-ninjanokia-ambassador-lance-mccarthy/) at Microsoft and Nokia, Lance sought out and engaged developers through outreach programs and provides them with technical support and resources to make them successful on the various Microsoft platforms and stores.

During the day, Lance is the Manager of US Technical Support at Progress Software, covering the Telerik and Kendo DevTools. Previously he spent 9 years there as a engineer himself, specializing in .NET tooling. Lance and his team supports developers and teams from Fortune 500 companies with their enterprise and consumer applications using Telerik and Kendo UI components.

Lance was also an Assistant Professor at Harvard University, where he helped students build, market and publish successful Windows & Windows Phone applications. He also spent a few years as a quest lecturer at Boston University for the cloud computing students.

He has also appeared on podcasts such as the Windows Developer Show ([here](http://windowsdevelopershow.com/2013/04/episode-113-app-kitchen/), [here](http://windowsdevelopershow.com/2014/01/episode-144-leisure-suit-lance/) and [here](http://windowsdevelopershow.com/2014/11/episode-167-mvp-summit/)), has been a [technical editor for publications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn451441.aspx) and [books](https://www.packtpub.com/netduino-home-automation-projects-for-lazy-boys/book), has won several app building contests and hackathons (including [first place](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/9-014) the Microsoft Build 2013 hackathon), and is a published developer with over a dozen apps in the Microsoft App Stores.

## On Behalf of Microsoft

For about 7-8 years, I did a lot of behind-the-scenes work for Microsoft; as a ghost blog writer, video producer, and handling the official social media accounts (using Sprinklr and eventually Sprout). It was a great experience that I dont want to lose these resume fillers and wanted to compile the top items here.

You’ll probably recognize many of these items and had no idea that I was behind the camera/pen. Enjoy the nostalgia!

## Official Microsoft Blog Posts

For a couple years, I was the main content creator behind the Windows Developer blog content. I published under the "Windows App Team" pen name, with a few exceptions where the byline was a more specific person (like the Michael Crump series). The following links are my posts from those years (at least the ones I was able to remember).

Unfortunately, there are several more that I can’t find links to and are lost to time. However, I built many great friendships while I was there that can attest to my participation in both the blog content, but also the live event content (particularly Microsoft Build).

### Code && Coffee conversations with developers

As I mentioned above, some of that content involved social media, here are some interviews I had fun producing and performing form behind the Sprinker curtain (Sprinkler is how we'd tweet from many official Microsoft social media accounts).

- Atley Hunter [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Welcome to #CodeAndCoffee – our new series where we interview standout devs in the community! Today we’re talking to @AtleyHunter, MVP and dev extraordinaire.](https://twitter.com/windowsdev/status/984839303757901825)
- Ben Fox [Windows Developer on Twitter: “In today’s #CodeAndCoffee, we’re talking with Ben Fox (@ductionist) from @User_Camp](https://twitter.com/windowsdev/status/987367792318939136)
- Lucas Rizzotto [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Happy Monday devs! In our latest installment of #CodeAndCoffee, we’re tweeting with @_LucasRizzotto](https://twitter.com/windowsdev/status/998601817545166850)
- Ginny Caughey [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Welcome to another edition of #CodeAndCoffee! This week we’re talking to #BuildMC Ginny Caughey](https://twitter.com/windowsdev/status/1005125157852098560)
- Michael West [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Hey devs, welcome back to another round of #CodeAndCoffee! Today we’re chatting with Michael West](https://twitter.com/windowsdev/status/1010198226467721217)

### Code Review interviews I had with developers:

- Tom Verhoeff [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Welcome to #CodeReview – our new series where devs discuss the inspiration behind their code! Today we’re talking to @tomverhoeff, founder of @Methylium and #Windows10 expert, about his BuildCast app.]()
- Neils [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Welcome to another #CodeReview! Today we’re talking to #WindowsDevAwards finalist @Niels9001 about Fluent Design System and his app, Huetro!]()
- Stephen Hodgson [Windows Developer on Twitter: “Good morning devs! For today’s #CodeReview we’re chatting with @StephenHodgson_, a moderator for the MixedRealityToolkit on @GitHub.]()

#### GitHub Code

Although much of the code I’ve written has been merged into official demos at some point, there are still some items that are outside that curtain. Here are the items I could find:

- [microsoft/windows-developer-blog-samples · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-developer-blog-samples)
- [microsoft/github-actions-for-desktop-apps · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/github-actions-for-desktop-apps)

## Hackathons

As a hackathon veteran, I've hosted and judged dozens of hackathons; from MIT and Harvard, to many brand-sponsored events. I have also participated in many hackathons as a contestant, never lost an event. Usually 1st or 2nd place, couple 3rd place. Here are some of my favorite wins:

- [iSmack](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2013/07/05/ismack-wins-build-hackathon-for-best-windows-phone-app/) at Microsoft Build 2013 Conference (my favorite!)
- [Readicle](http://web.archive.org/web/20211020094143/https://developer.att.com/blog/at-amp-t-mobile-app-hackathon-boston-recap) at AT&T Hackathon. I won 2nd place overall and 1st place for Windows Phone. (Apple ended up monetizing this idea)
- [Latte Locator](http://web.archive.org/web/20220117074724/https://developer.att.com/blog/category/hackathon/at-amp-t-mobile-app-hackathon-boston) at AT&T MIT Hackathon – published [in the Microsoft Store here](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/latte-locator/184a19d5-af23-488d-bce3-6dc0a9b3f17e) and see the winners blog here.
- [Video Diary]() at Microsoft Hackathon in 2011 – published in the Microsoft Store here (nearly 1 million users). Thanks to Bob Familiar for saving photos in a Flickr photo album for this event! Here are some shots I am in:
